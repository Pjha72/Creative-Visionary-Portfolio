              Hello! I'm Pawan, and I'm based in Mumbai, India. I am currently
              studying Computer Science and Engineering at Thakur College of
              Engineering and Technology. I am a self-taught Developer &
              Programmer and a person who loves to learn new things. I have been
              working on my skills for quiet sometime now. I started Programming
              with C++ and then graduated to C++. While learning, I created
              some projects based on them; such as a Student Result Management
              System, Star Music, Text Utills, Newsgenix and many more!! Then,
              recently I have started learning Front-End Web-Development, and
              covered HTML, CSS and JavaScript...then proceeded towards Tailwind
              CSS, and Iâ€™m still continuing that journey forward. And, in the
              mean time, I was also creating some projects based of my learnings
              on Web-Development. I am looking forward to learn about MERN, and
              Back-End Web Development in the coming future. These are some
              topics of my excellence:
